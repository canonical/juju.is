    <h2>What is Operator Day?</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-6">
      <p>Software operators are crucial in the <a href="https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes">Kubernetes landscape</a>. A software operator encapsulates the knowledge and expertise of a real-world operations team and codifies it into a dedicated piece of software. Software operators help human operators and administrators run their applications efficiently and effectively.</p>
      <p>Canonical has redefined how we operate applications and provides <a href="https://juju.is/">an OSS-based platform and framework</a> for building and running operators.</p>
      <p>And what better place to talk about operators than KubeCon? KubeCon is a bi-annual event in Europe and North America, with presentations, sessions, tutorials and hands-on demos for open-source communities building cloud-native applications.</p>
      <p>It is the most significant event for cloud-native computing, receiving more than 15.000 registrations in the past. KubeCon is the flagship conference of the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)</a>.
        Canonical has inaugurated the Operator Day event at KubeCon conference in 2020. If you missed them, you could freely access recordings from the sessions <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@UbuntuOS/playlists">on YouTube</a>.</p>
