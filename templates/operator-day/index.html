      <h2 class="p-heading--3">Find out at Operator Day</h2>
      <p>Since 2020, Canonical has delivered Operator Day events, colocated at KubeCon, to showcase what operators are, how to use them, how to create them and how you can benefit from them.</p>
      <p>This year, the 8th edition of Operator Day will take place online, co-located with KubeCon EU 2024 in Paris, on Tuesday, 19 March 2024. Join us to learn about operators for some of the most popular open source software, including PostgreSQL and MongoDB</p>

    <h2>What is Operator Day?</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-6">
      <p>Software operators are crucial in the <a href="https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes">Kubernetes landscape</a>. A software operator encapsulates the knowledge and expertise of a real-world operations team and codifies it into a dedicated piece of software. Software operators help human operators and administrators to run their applications efficiently and effectively.</p>
      <p>Canonical has redefined how we operate applications and provides <a href="/">an OSS-based platform and framework</a> for building and running operators.</p>
      <p>And what better place to talk about operators than KubeCon? KubeCon is a bi-annual event in Europe and North America, with presentations, sessions, tutorials and hands-on demos for open-source communities building cloud-native applications.</p>
      <p>It is the most significant event for cloud-native computing, receiving more than 15,000 registrations in the past. KubeCon is the flagship conference of the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)</a>.
        Canonical launched the inaugural Operator Day at the KubeCon conference in 2020. If you missed our past events, you can freely access recordings from the sessions <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@UbuntuOS/playlists">on YouTube</a>.</p>

       <h3>What to expect from the next Operator Day at KubeCon EU 2024?</h3>

       <p>At this edition of operator day, we will take a closer look at specific operators for some of your favourite open source software.</p>
       <p>The presentations will focus on operators for popular open source software running on Kubernetes to create cloud-native solutions, including:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>The PostgreSQL operator in action: Database servers are typical cases for automating operational tasks. See how the charm for PostgreSQL covers automation for disaster recovery and other management tasks.</li>
         <li>A charm for the popular MongoDB: a great example of a sophisticated workload that scales to an enterprise level is MongoDB. Learn how a charm for MongoDB supports deployment, management, patching and upgrading on Kubernetes or IaaS clouds.</li>
         <li>Modern Relationship-based Access Control (ReBAC) with OpenFGA: A context-aware ReBAC model based on OpenFGA provides more flexibility and expressiveness – perfect for running operators. See how the open source orchestration engine Juju takes advantage of a modern, state-of-the-art, fine-grained access model.</li>
