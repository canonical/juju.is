      <p>Co-located at KubeCon NA 2023 on 6 November 2023, we presented <a href="https://app.myonvent.com/event/operator-day/" class="p-link--inverted">Operator Day for the 7th time</a>. It was the ideal introduction to how operators work and how to create them using the Charm SDK for Juju – but if you couldn’t make it to the event, don’t worry, we have good news.</p>
      <p>Starting January 4th, we will present weekly on-demand events covering the presentations step by step. We will stream the presentations and answer your questions in a live chat.</p>

    <h2>What is Operator Day?</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-6">
      <p>Software operators are crucial in the <a href="https://ubuntu.com/kubernetes">Kubernetes landscape</a>. A software operator encapsulates the knowledge and expertise of a real-world operations team and codifies it into a dedicated piece of software. Software operators help human operators and administrators to run their applications efficiently and effectively.</p>
      <p>Canonical has redefined how we operate applications and provides <a href="/">an OSS-based platform and framework</a> for building and running operators.</p>
      <p>And what better place to talk about operators than KubeCon? KubeCon is a bi-annual event in Europe and North America, with presentations, sessions, tutorials and hands-on demos for open-source communities building cloud-native applications.</p>
      <p>It is the most significant event for cloud-native computing, receiving more than 15,000 registrations in the past. KubeCon is the flagship conference of the <a href="https://www.cncf.io/">Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)</a>.
        Canonical has inaugurated the Operator Day event at KubeCon conference in 2020. If you missed them, you could freely access recordings from the sessions <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@UbuntuOS/playlists">on YouTube</a>.</p>

       <h3>How was Operator Day at KubeCon NA 2023?</h3>

       <p>The most recent Operator Day covered the entire journey of an engineering team, exploring software operators with hands-on sessions. Based on feedback from previous attendees,  we covered the step-by-step creation of an operator for <a href="/">Juju</a>, called a charm, using the <a href="/docs/sdk">Charm SDK</a>. The programme included:</p>

       <ul>
         <li>How to write the first lines of code to create a charm</li>
         <li>How to extend the charm with certificate management, single sign-on and observability</li>
         <li>How to deploy and publish the charm to MicroK8s on AWS</li>
       </ul>

      <p>The presentations showed the path from zero to a production-grade charm ready for Juju. Because the sessions did not focus on slides but on showing interactions within the terminal, IDEs and web browsers, everyone can follow the steps in their own environments. The <a href="https://github.com/operatorinc">code is freely accessible on Github</a>.</p>

      <p>If you missed this Operator Day, we have good news for you: each of these presentations will be covered in our series of on-demand events every week, starting on January 4th. We hope to see you there!</p>
